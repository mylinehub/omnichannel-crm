In summary, there are four different ways to present certificates and their components:
PEM - Governed by RFCs, used preferentially by open-source software because it is text-based and therefore less prone to translation/transmission errors. It can have a variety of extensions (.pem, .key, .cer, .cert, more)
PKCS7 - An open standard used by Java and supported by Windows. Does not contain private key material.
PKCS12 - A Microsoft private standard that was later defined in an RFC that provides enhanced security versus the plain-text PEM format. This can contain private key and certificate chain material. Its used preferentially by Windows systems, and can be freely converted to PEM format through use of openssl.
DER - The parent format of PEM. It's useful to think of it as a binary version of the base64-encoded PEM file. Not routinely used very much outside of Windows.


(ONE TIME ACTIVITY) SHOULD BE ALREADY DONE ONE TIME ACTIVITY:
Install CertBot (It generates PEM files)
(Donot Run below 4 commands)
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
sudo apt-get update

(Run this command)
sudo apt-get install certbot python3-certbot-nginx  (It comes different package for apache)
sudo snap install core; sudo snap refresh core
sudo snap install --classic certbot
sudo ln -s /snap/bin/certbot /usr/bin/certbot



(RENEW ACTIVITY)
sudo su
cd /etc/letsencrypt/live
rm -r ./app.mylinehub.com/  (Donot delete-0001)
certbot delete
sudo certbot --nginx -d app.mylinehub.com
sudo systemctl status certbot.timer
sudo certbot renew --dry-run

If Required use (rm -rf app.mylinehub.com-0001- it removes directory which is non empty) or else rename (mv -T app.mylinehub.com-0001 app.mylinehub.com )
Copy contents of one folder to another (cp -a /etc/letsencrypt/live/app.mylinehub.com/. /etc/letsencrypt/live/app.mylinehub.com-0001/)


root@ubuntu-HP-Notebook:/etc/letsencrypt/live/app.mylinehub.com# sudo certbot --nginx -d app.mylinehub.com
Saving debug log to /var/log/letsencrypt/letsencrypt.log
Requesting a certificate for app.mylinehub.com

Successfully received certificate.
Certificate is saved at: /etc/letsencrypt/live/app.mylinehub.com/fullchain.pem
Key is saved at:         /etc/letsencrypt/live/app.mylinehub.com/privkey.pem
This certificate expires on 2025-10-10.
These files will be updated when the certificate renews.
Certbot has set up a scheduled task to automatically renew this certificate in the background.

Deploying certificate
Successfully deployed certificate for app.mylinehub.com to /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
Congratulations! You have successfully enabled HTTPS on https://app.mylinehub.com


cd /etc/letsencrypt/live/app.mylinehub.com/


Convert PEM files to PK12 and Cert files using Open SSL
Install OpenSSL
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openssl



Deprecated
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:certbot/certbot         (It is deprecated and not required now. Run command sudo add-apt-repository -r ppa:certbot/certbot to remove)
