5) Browse Available MBeans
To check all available MBeans that your Spring Boot application exposes, use the following command:
beans

This will display all the registered MBeans. For example, you might see something like:
mylinehub.backend:type=ThreadPool,name=AsyncExecutor
mylinehub.backend:type=Memory,name=HeapMemory
...


6) Query MBeans for Specific Metrics
You can query specific MBeans to get detailed metrics. For example:
Threads in your Spring Boot application:
get -b mylinehub.backend:type=ThreadPool,name=AsyncExecutor

Memory usage of your application:
get -b mylinehub.backend:type=Memory,name=HeapMemory


7) Exit JMXTerm
