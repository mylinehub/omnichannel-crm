MYLINEHUB is a software development company. And we developed it softwares. Most of the language made by Java backend. Angular front and react front end Python backend development or any other language. We do have expertise in telecommunication. And WhatsApp marketing. We provide a full flow. From receiving a WhatsApp. Using a Facebook ad. An as soon as you get a message. Tomorrow information is stay of stored in table. The customer name are fed from WhatsApp record itself. And it gets stored in table. After that. We have this customer record. And. Chat with the AI bot so the AI bot is nothing but the Rag. Particular composition which I am recording from speech to text is also for rack. Show for WhatsApp automation first what we need to do is we need to have a WhatsApp number from our client that WhatsApp number Would Be registered to our cloud. Client will have to. Battery release date number from WhatsApp business mobile application or else WhatsApp client application. He or she will not be able to use it it is very important that we always make sure that the client knows this. So he or she will not be able to use that WhatsApp number which is on cloud using regular WhatsApp application. They will be able to see the WhatsApp application on our portal. And in our portal we have lots of benefits which they can use. Sona single WhatsApp number if a customer sends in a message multiple users from your organisation or the person who gets attached with us. Can reply back to that person. Integrated multiple user use cases. In our application. So this way the manager knows which employee is replying what. And everything is getting recorded. We do have dashboards which tell. What exactly how many messages were sent how many AI messages were sent how many manual messages were sent. Suman. We want to have graphs. Can be used for the same purpose.
Let us move further. Say for example if someone wants to create a scenario where the person the customer is messaging an organisation and he asked to schedule a call. System is capable of scheduling the call. And the call can be scheduled and everything will be recorded at the backend. Provides two ways. Of calling one is using the mobile app where the person can click on a button and as soon as you click on the button the mobile number will go to the. Mobile front screen. And person can die. His own Sim. Mobile number actually goes to the dial pad. Second is using the. Servers. You have a telecommunication setup where we sell. Costing of WhatsApp. Application is Rs 1 per outgoing message. Open Messenger completely free. Each outgoing message whether it is manual message AI message or any other. Each outgoing message will be casted. While the telecommunication is. Priced as per number of seats. Say for example you have 10 agents so every agent will be. Will be charged per seat basis as like and the amount is to INR Indian National Rupee 2000 per seat. Say for example if your organisation has 15 employees. We can give you 10 seeds. Consider a seat as a channel but you can have 15 employees. In parallel only 10 seats. 10 call can be. So number of seats does not equal to number of users the number of users can be more number of seats can be less number of seat means how many parallel calls can be made. The calling number depends on what kind of server you take from US say for example if you take a server on Pri line so in India the legal laws are very strict and if you are taking a PR on a line you will only get landline numbers. And landline numbers pertain to the server. State it belongs. Situated in Noida. Support both on like on premise setup and cloud setup our cloud setup like all of these awards are in Noida and we do not provide Pri line on cloud we do have GSM gateways and you can use. Your sim card so for. We will like ask you for a SIM card. And in this Rs 2000 the recharge of SIM card is included. Already. So but but the SIM card will be on your name and you will have to send that sim card to us in another approach which is on premise approach you can have parallel in GSM Gateway whatever you want and the billing of the software depends on. The number the number of users you have died so you can buy software at once for telecommunication it is. 5000 per user for lifetime say you are billing for 10 users it will be 25. 1000 into 10. Which is 250000. For the software additional 50000 cost INR I am all the cost is in INR additional 50000 cost will be applied for setup charges for on premise. And the maintenance of on premise system depends on the client we are not responsible for that.
 Let's move forward. If you talk more about the calculation part so the calculation part of odb which is out outgoing direct call odb out on direct call. Call on to my system like it comes out to be very less. You get all the details on a centralised server. Even the WhatsApp telecommunication everything gets on centralised server. So we add my line now we are a platform where we do custom development today you have a requirement of messaging WhatsApp message in telecommunication we do it all. Example you have a retirement any any requirement which you are trying to get sorted somewhere you tell us one retirement and we will set it up for you. First retirement setup is free only setup is free and initially we allow you to use our system for free for few days. You can try our system completely free for few days. This free system does not include telecommunication at all we do not provide telecommunication free at all but you can try WhatsApp messaging the portal how it behaves. Until. Android messages. So when you login you register 100 matches are given. How do you register Chotu register to the application network. Go to App dot my lineup com. Https colon slash / 2. Going to this website if you are a Indian origin user. You just need to add GST number. Will be registered automatically. What are you register you will get a WhatsApp you will get an email. Text message I think maybe not the text message but WhatsApp an email. Credentials. As you login. You will be able to see the portal and you will be able to diversion. But we do not. Update. Your WhatsApp number. I want to add your WhatsApp number to cloud. You will have to give us one number we will add to cloud we will ask you the OTP we will set it up and then the point is you cannot use this number at all. WhatsApp application. We will have to be registered. Deregistered you will have to again drop us an email and only after that email we will be registered. You will have to do drop an email for registering a number only after will registered so this email is the consent. The time taken to register your number is one day Maximum 2 days. In the same way the time taken to deregister your number is. Sources for example you submit a request today in two days we will discharge and we will of board you and we can give back your system to you. To make sure everyone knows that it is very important to understand like WhatsApp marketing this is this should be the first message which should be going to everyone where they should be knowing that WhatsApp marketing requires. Have your number on cloud.
 Should be particularly talk about telecommunications may it be IVR. Cuse. Extensions. Telling a user that a company is not working at this time. Putting up custom Logix. Creating up the transcriptions. And way more. We supported all. We have a system which connects to multiple aspects over so you do not need to worry if you have 5000 people and due to voice calling its always heavy traffic and one server cannot supported so if you have multiple servers. It is a platform which gives you a centralised. Face and one CRM which connects to multiple aspects of at the back end so this is basically a you can consider it as a star where our my lineup is one system and it is connected to. Hundreds of servers at the backend. It will get any tall. This is the power of my lineup. Centralised system. For messaging and telecommunication both. This again becomes our power that we are we have integrated WhatsApp and telecommunication both in one CRM system. This is being created by very few people in the industry.
 complete this Rag document when I will share this to Ai I want AI to make sure that it features all the important features of WhatsApp because we can deliver it all say for example if someone wants to send template messages. We have the feasibility of sending a template messages two system so. They can have these like as soon as like they are creating of this customer data so anyone. Messaging your support number their records are saved automatically so your database keeps on creating automatically you do not have to write it down and do all of those things when we talk about the data security aspects we are very secure we do not use your data we do not need to use your data so we have our own client base and like all of our client base are. Are segregated using organisations of one organisation is never shared data of another organisation and its all in encrypted for you not even our employees can like are able to see up the data. And there are like Limited number of admins which have access to course overs. Apart from this we always make sure that your data is secure and is tightly coupled with organisation. While we give you feasibility of. Getting your data in Excel format say for example you have got the customer data of. Customers so we will give you the data of 10000 customers. Excel format or else. We will we can like you can give us. Your database and we can. API to fetch your data. So that depends everything has do have a. So it depends on what task you have. We are very prone to custom development we do not deny so tomorrow you have any requirement we would be able to do it. We are very cheap. Related to the industry. Just try a sound once. We will make sure that. Come up to the capability for trying a sound we do not take a lot of money it's absolutely free you can come and see the platform. First what are the steps. Registered with us first thing we would need a mobile number. Which is not registered on WhatsApp. We will registered the mobile number on cloud. You will not be able to register on WhatsApp then. Second as soon as be registered we will start the things for you and you can run a thousand rupees add. As soon as the arts start people will start shooting messages on your WhatsApp number incoming messages are totally free. And we will. Sure that you can see all the messages. Have the reporting. Then if you want we can set a bag so for free what we can give you is we can maximum give you a Rag of three pages not more than that three documents. Weekend scrap your data. Excel format pdf format Word format link. In links. Search Deep. For other links as well within a website. Scrapping and preparing a vector DB against chargeable but for initial setup to showcase you its completely free but to a limited length. I told you link or not. Free system. Scrap links for free. To test the system free you can give us a word document. At most three pages we will. Hindi Bhakti tv and you can see how the auto responses are. For people who want to do rack for commercial or selling purpose of products. Example we are doing it for services. Do you want to do is the products so we will be saving of the product information links everything in Rag as per the customer description. And product description the product will be faced. The links and everything will be shown up to the system to the person. We can code up where we can there we can say that if you like it you can just buy it from WhatsApp as well so all of these things are possible but every scenario is different so say for that we do not deny on scenarios first is like how we charge first is we create the first scenario which is free UPS. Amount to create this second scenario UPS some amount. Point is first we create. Can you pay.
 How we created this Rag. He did not scrapped or right. World. How we created by gathered like we gathered our sales people and. Ask them to talk. So when they were talking. We were recording their. It was converted from speech to text. All of these data was collaborated together and it was sent to. LLM and LLM created the Rag document for us so it did not react data created the Rag document for us using all the data be provided and using this rack document. Period of this. TV for ragging.
 Considering all the servers are owned by my line hub. How we make sure that the data is secured and it is never reached. But. Customer things that the data remains to him for this use case he will have to set up on premise system. Only and on premise system can have the complete data. To the customer but it is always a costly. On premise is always costly because you will have to buy first the Machines pay the charge for the software. Why the software from us which is for on premise we do not give you this. Mode at all. Should be the first line which should be mentioned by the Rag we do not give the source code at all we only give the binaries. So we will add those binaries and give to the client it is clients responsibility to save those binaries with them because we will not provide those binaries again. Maintenance of the Ores on premise system is complete responsibility of client if they want to. Maintenance by us. You have to hire people and they remain to my Lena but they will work for the client. Casting off maintenance depends on number of servers and number of people required. At least one person would be there and the charges salary everything has to be born by the client my lineup will charge. 30% of the salary. Employee.
 So what's next so. What if you want to connect my lineup with. Second services such as Amazon. Show Amazon has its own. Show the power of my line hobbies it can connect with any septum. So say for example if you are in US India VR. National software and we support all kind of numbers and every Geography in this world. It depends on the. From where you buy the trunk or. The which country sim card you have. If the SIM card in trunk belongs to a particular country our system is capable of supporting it so we do not restrict ourselves with respect of geography. Our system works on every kind of. Number. Only that. We should have the resources to integrate it and set it up so integration set up everything. TVS task. Switch on the number of users. The amount of work required but system. Capabilities to integrate. Provide you the data.
 So we are using free pbx. Version as our. Pbx which is connected to my lineup. Using astrix Java. So using this free pbx we can connect to any trunk. So just to make sure that we understand this. I when I pass this document to. LLM to prepare a rack document for us I want to make sure that LLM pics. All the capabilities. Pbx and put it in this document for Rag so that. Find the similarities research we have bottle capabilities free pbx hack. Show the capabilities of free pbx and WhatsApp marketing are detailed out. Say what kind of templates we support with support every template if it's not there will created. Restrict yourself in saying that. How it is possible using WhatsApp Let's create it. And let's tell customer that we already have it because most of the sentence we already have it it's just that we need to write few lines of code and it's done so which can be done in few hours. It's not just about WhatsApp or. Telecommunication marketing its even about. Custom development. My line of system has been built from scratch. We have not taken busy dial and upgraded it. We have not taken some other. WhatsApp an upgraded. Created everything and that's the power we have because we are experts in coding so custom development making custom requirements becomes very easy for us. That's why we offer this thing that you come as come to us try us for free. Once scenario. We will let you sell.
 There are a number of customers. Who come and ask us. What are the legalities of telecommunication in India. Aur other countries. In other countries the shift trunk you can get on cloud. Even Amazon does not provide shift trunk in India. It is mandatory to have a on premise server for ship in India. We do have our own premise server as we told you. Using GSM Gateway but it's all in all using SIM card. But if you are looking out for PR online. GSM Gateway is not so scalable. GSM gateway has a limitation of. Current users so One GSM Gateway can provide you only five concurrent lines. If you are looking out for. Multiple concurrent lines either you can have multiple GSM gateways or else you need a PRL line. But for P r r p r i line. Only landline numbers are given. For example if you are in Delhi your number of PRI line will start from 0 1 1. If you are in Bangalore it will start from 080. So it is not show that you have a server in Delhi and you will get a number of 080 it is not allowed. Second if you are doing cold call. Old call is not allowed at all using these numbers for cold calling you will have to buy different numbers from parallel line even GSM Gateway SIM cards are not allowed to send cold call so if you. We are company which is giving which we are giving us you get a incoming message on WhatsApp and then you call them so that is not a cold call. You can make that call using. Mobile number. But if you have a database and your randomly calling a number that is a cold call you cannot call. Any person cold call. Using mobile number or even landline number starting from 011080 or like that. As per government rules in India you will have to start it. Using. Make a bracket over here. This has to be checked and fixed.
 What if I set a number in India but I am in London. Can I connect to a call yes. To a call. As per Technology but. As per legality in India. We being a technical company we do not understand legalities of all the countries so we make sure that whenever we sell a telecommunication line. Anyone it is them who are responsible for making sure that the legality is maintained. Guide you. On the same. We cannot even sell you numbers. For selling numbers we do not have.
 So do we sell numbers no we don't sell numbers. It is client responsibility to buy a number and give it to us we will set it up for them. We will sign a memorandum. With them to make sure that the system or sim card is with us. And it is being used by the CRM tool. Again the CRM tool is in hands of the client itself and their people. They can make the call call from the SIM card from their home even when the SIM card is in our GSM gateway. Our cloud based solution is. Applicable for work from home even if you are buying a on premise system then also. Applicable from work from home so you can set up a system on your office and people can use the CRM tool from their home using normal internet. Do you require for that for setting up a. My system. You will need an Internet connection a static IP. Server our software. For calling 1 GSM gateway or prr line. And we can set it up all for you.
 So if there is something which for which we do not have answer. We want to make sure that. The prompt. Ask user. The appropriate question as well. So I think this is something which will not go into Rag but this will going to Prompt.
 So do we support media for WhatsApp messages yes we do support media for WhatsApp messages. For the free version you do not get media and for getting media support. Charges so consultant. Wires space. Initially only 50 MB. Is given to every organisation for free. So if you are looking out for media definitely you would need more space so the space is chargeable per month and it is approximately 1000 rupees for 1GB. So INR 1000 for 1GB per month so you can you have 1GB of space for entire organisation say your rat pipeline or your sales pipeline has. Documents you can store all of them it has videos audios. We will scrap the transcription of audio video and all of the things you have and stored in vector d. As per the question asked from client it will even response in text. And related we have the link it will. So the person can see the text and they can even see the link.
 How many users do we provide for free. As of now the system has three kind of users. Admin employee and manager. Admin can do everything. Manager can do also everything apart from few things there is very slightly different from manager and admin but to know that you might have to use the system and third is employee. Show the employee will not be able to see the report he will not be able to see all the employees. Only admin will be. Is the admin capable of creating new users no. If you want to create new users in a system you will have to drop us an email. We will verify the users we. Their records and they will get an email and WhatsApp both. As soon as their account has been created so they will have their password they can login and they can change the password. For free account you can maximum have five users. If you do not recharge the system. Annual account balance is less than 50. And you do not recharge the system. Sound automatically gets deactivated in 10 days. So if you do not. Recharge the system your account.
 Can we use the system for. Automated pipelines yes. Can we use the system for cold calling. Can we use a system for building your marketing funnels yes can we automate WhatsApp yes can we automate telecommunication yes can we automate messages yes can we automate emails. Anything else tell us your requirement. Budget. We would be happy to help you.
 Do I need to pay anything initially no you do not need to pay anything initially. You just have to give us a phone number. Dad phone number we will link to our WhatsApp account. You will not be able to use that phone number at all after that. Comes to our portal if you want to delete you will have to raise a request you will have to wait for two days we will be registered it.
 I have only two users can I buy seeds from you. You can buy WhatsApp and telecommunication seeds both we do not have a requirement of any minimum user. Considering we do not sell the phone numbers. SIM cards are provided by user client themselves on their name we just plug them up in the system. How to get the system up and running inform the client and inform the client can. So even if you have just one user or two user you are a single member person. We are there to help you.
 My team is using another CRM tool and it is costing us 50% per seat charges compared to what you are giving. Absolutely there are a lot of. Vendors in the market doing a lot of things we charged based on our expertise and capabilities there will be very few people in the market who will give you a complete centralised system with WhatsApp automation and telecommunication both. If you are have if your if you are getting someone else who is paying who is paying to whom you have to pay less and then also you will get the same things. Please let us know. We would verify the source considering. We would. Best you to try. That platform as well.
 I have my own CRM system. But I want all of these capabilities embedded with us. What you can do is you can just. Backend system it will give you all the API again our backend system depends on number of users and it is 25000 per user when you buy it for lifetime. So when you buy it you get the current version. And you are eligible to get. Free updates only till next. After that. Not get any updated version. So it is not necessary that in next 3 months we would be making up any change in the software so considerate this way you buy a system.
 So in the Rag please remove the 3 months. Just tell that if you buy a system at. X version. Exposure and you are not liable to get further updates. So you can just embedded that. Executable in your backend and you have that executive we will train your people. The training will happen only once you can record that sessions then after if you need any maintenance or help we can align some resource to you for one month. You can take the help. It depends on how long you need the support but. Initial free training for on premise system happens only once.
 What if I need. More graphs reporting. To my on my system. If you need more features to your answer my system you can send as the details we can we would like estimated and tell you the amount of development. Development amount depends on the number of task and days it will require a number of people it will require we will give you a quote if you are satisfied we will start the development and we will do all the development of get it approved from you and then we will. Open new executable and give it to you. That you can use with your system.
 I am on the cloud version. I have custom requirements. No we do not support client custom requirements. On cloud based without pay. If they have a specific requirement. As per their organisation we will be ready to build it but even on cloud. Structure is as per organisation. Organisation we have the capability to add or subtract different my line hub modules. One front and you will see only those modules which have been added for your organisation so you have any custom requirement to create another module for you and that will be visible only to you so the cloud system depends if you if you already have a huge traffic with us and your paying us already. Then we don't then we may do not charge you for additional development. But if you are traffic is less. Then we might have to so it is completely scenario based so how much charges are there for custom development on cloud. Depends on your current spending with us. Current relation. As per that. Will caught an amount for your custom development and. The system.
 Is MYLINEHUB responsible for any data loss. Server downtime. My line hub does not take any. Data loss or server time town on cloud. We have our server setups and we are already providing services at a very cheap rate.
 How many days it will take to set up initially if I go with my line hub. You just need to register give us the phone number. We will set it up in one or Maximum 2 days. The estimation for us to set it up s for. Considering bad scenario. Abhi will take like as per like legality or paper we do not commit any time. In most cases. Give us the phone number and OTP. Working on our cloud. Us and our. To set up your system. Show in how many days we set it up for you. You give us the phone number. Register it on cloud ask you the OTP. I will give you the system in few hours.
 How much time will it take for you to set up the telecommunication seat. My unemployed. To set up telecommunication need for your one employee. We will take not more than one day. You will give us you will ask you all the details and we will set the telecommunication seat for your employee. Revert back.
 We have already. Client data with us. X format. Would you be able to fetch the data and put it on your system yes. We would be able to fetch any kind of data Beat be Excel PDF images anything we will ocr images. Extract data from documents we can connect database. Bring your data in our server. You need to understand which format you have your. And we can bring it to our server. It will be again a cost effective. Activity and you will have to pay. The development of complexity involved in the scenario. Is it possible to. Send your client data to your CRM. Is it possible to send client data customer data from my lineup database servers to client database yes. We will provide the API you can consume it. Get the synchronisation of your data. Does it cost. No. Considering the Client or customer data we have is yours. Charge you for exposing this API and getting it integrated on your CRM.
 Do we have mobile application for my lineup CRM. Yes this system. Build and is mobile responsive. You can open it on Chrome. Open it on Safari you can. Any web browser. It works. Open it on desktop you can mobile. We even have mobile native applications.
 What all features do we have in telecommunication we have listened quietly we can monitor employees if someone is engaged or not if someone is sitting idle. We have progressive dialling we have predictive dialling we have IVR dialling say you want to call 500 employees one by one. Everyone should hear the IVR yes. Divisibility is there. So we have auto tiling of various kinds. Again it depends on number of seats you have and there is a fixed amount for each seat and then you can call any amount. If you have five concurrent. Live channels. You have find five concurrent channels. A person will make a call the. Call to the client your channel will be used. If your employee receives the call. CRM web phone. We do have a web phone as well. Your client. Gets a call and your employer receives the call on the phone you will use only one channel. But if you call the customer on mobile and your even your employee wants the phone on mobile. That is also possible but that will. Consume 2 channels for. One employee. So if you are. And you are making a call to the customer on mobile. Why is also getting call on mobile. Only two employees can walk parallel. But if you have. Five employees and all the files are employees are working on my lineup portal using the web phone which is integrated on my lineup you will be able to use all the five channels. Parallelly. This is something which is an additional and saves cost. Lot of big clients. Who are doing this. Communication job but. They are they have to. Terminate the call on mobile. Is it legal to terminate call on ship. Considering our SIM cards are in GSM Gateway and as per what we understand. It will be a call happening using the ship channel. Our system is connected to ship. And the call is initiated from ship and it is terminated from ship. In between we have the SIM card. You can initiate the call.
 Do we have a privacy chat. Between employees. My lineup. Does not only support Whatsapp chat with customer or else telecommunication we have a chat separate chat module where one employee can talk to another employee using my liner resources only. It is completely free to use internal chat. But it has its own limitation.
What limitation internal chart has because it is completely free to use you cannot send big files. Media files you can only send text messages or small files. If you are worried about the privacy internally. Complete secured. So if you are thinking to have a system which is completely private and is not seen my anyone you can use my line.
