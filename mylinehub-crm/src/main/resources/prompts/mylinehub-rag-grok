## Section 1: Executive Summary

### Overview

MYLINEHUB is a software development company based in Noida, India. We specialize in building full-stack software solutions, with emphasis on communication automationâ€”especially WhatsApp messaging workflows, telecommunication (voice) systems (like GSM gateways, PRI lines, IVR, predictive dialers), and advanced AI-driven chatbots using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology.

Our core strengths:
- **Full software stack:** Java and Python backends, Angular/React frontends, deep integration into telecommunication frameworks like FreePBX/Asterisk.

## Section 3: Product & Service Portfolio

### WhatsApp Automation CRM

**What you get:**
- Capture all incoming WhatsApp customer contacts, log them to CRM.

**How it works:**

2. Data logged, agents notified.
3. AI replies (if set up) immediately.
4. All actions trackable & exportable.

#### Example Use Case
*"A student sends a course inquiry on WhatsApp at midnight. The AI answers instantly, schedules a callback, and logs the conversation for a counselor to follow up in the morning."*

***

### Telecommunication Systems (Voice, IVR, Dialers)

- Integrates GSM gateways (SIM-based) and PRI lines.
- Supports IVR menus, progressive/predictive/preview dialers, multi-agent routing, live call analytics.
- Recordings, sticky agent assignment, and high scalability via multiple servers.
- *Note: Cold calling using random lists is strictly controlled in India (see legal notes).*

#### Example Scenario
*"Your sales team can call back every WhatsApp lead. Missed calls or voicemails trigger WhatsApp follow-ups automatically."*
