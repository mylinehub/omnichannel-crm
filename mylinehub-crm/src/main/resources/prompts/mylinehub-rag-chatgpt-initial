## Section 1: Executive Summary

### Overview

MYLINEHUB is a software development company based in Noida, India, specialising in building full-stack software solutions with emphasis on communication automation , particularly WhatsApp messaging workflows, telecommunication (voice) systems (GSM gateways, PRI lines, IVR, predictive dialers), and AI-driven chatbots using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) technology.
The company's offering spans **Java** & **Python** back-ends, **Angular** and **React** front-ends, and integration into telecommunication frameworks such as FreePBX / Asterisk.
Their flagship proposition is: handle the full flow from an incoming WhatsApp message (via a Facebook/Meta ad) to storing customer data, to managing chat with the AI bot (RAG), to using telephony (voice calls, seats) and CRM dashboards , all in one centralised platform.
This makes MYLINEHUB a rare vendor offering unified WhatsApp + telephony + CRM + AI automation in one ecosystem.

### Mission

To empower businesses globally with smart, scalable, and fully automated communication platforms that seamlessly integrate messaging, voice, CRM workflows and AI-driven interactions , thereby converting every customer conversation into actionable data, automation and engagement.

### Vision

To become a global leader in unified communications and AI-driven customer engagement, enabling enterprises (of all sizes) to transform how they communicate with customers , moving from discrete messaging, calls, and chatbots to one cohesive, intelligent automation stack.

### Core Differentiators

* Built from scratch: The MYLINEHUB platform is developed in-house and not just an overlay on a third-party CRM like VICIdial or Bitrix.
* Unified platform: Combines WhatsApp integration + telephony (calls) + CRM + AI (RAG-driven) all in a single portal , offering both inbound and outbound workflows.
* Strong customisation: Using core technologies (Java, Python, Angular, React) allows high flexibility for domain-specific workflows and unique client requirements.
* Data security & client isolation: Each client's data is isolated, encrypted, and stored such that no other client's data is sharing resources. Even MYLINEHUB employees have limited access.
* Free trial/demo: Clients can test the platform before committing, reinforcing confidence.
* Global reach: While headquartered in India, the architecture supports international numbers, GSM gateways, PRI lines and global trunking (dependent on region) so the platform is not India-only.

## Section 3: Product & Service Portfolio

### 3.1 WhatsApp Automation CRM

**Key Capabilities:**

* Inbound WhatsApp: When a customer messages the client's WhatsApp number, the system captures the message, extracts customer name & contact info (if process configured), and stores it in a table.
* Outbound WhatsApp: Supports template messages (only approved templates can be used for outbound initiation) and media messages (images, audio, video).
* Multi-agent access: One WhatsApp number can be accessed by multiple users/agents via the portal; managers can track who replies and monitor threads.
* AI chat integration: The RAG-powered bot can respond to customer input, using internal data sources, and escalate to manual agents if needed.
* Dashboards: Shows metrics , total messages, AI replies vs manual replies, failed deliveries, conversion counts (converted/not converted).
* Session rules: If a customer initiates a chat, within 24 hours the client can respond; after that, only template messages can initiate. This matches WhatsApp policy.
* Media storage: Free tier includes 50 MB; additional storage at INR1,000 per GB/month.
* Multilingual support: Additional languages supported at INR2,000/month per language.
* Free trial: Clients can register (with GST number in India) and get access; up to e.g. 100 messages allowed in the trial.
* Number registration: Client selects a mobile number not already used on WhatsApp (or business app) , the number is moved to the cloud platform; once added, it cannot be used on the regular WhatsApp app by the client.
  **Important Notes:**
* When transferring the number to cloud, OTP is required and deregistration requires email request; typical registration time 1-2 business days.
* If client stops recharging, the system will deactivate in ~10 days.
* The FAQ: Can you edit a WhatsApp message once sent? No , WhatsApp doesn't support edit via cloud API (as of 2025).
* The FAQ: Can you initiate a WhatsApp conversation with a customer? Only via approved message templates; you cannot cold-initiate a message to a random contact outside the 24-hour window.

### 3.2 Telecommunication System

**Built on:** FreePBX + Asterisk + Java backend.
**Supports:** GSM gateway (SIM card based) and PRI lines.
**Deployment Models:** Cloud (GSM gateway in Noida-based servers) and on-premise.
**Features:**

* IVR: Multi-level menus, auto attendants.
* Predictive Dialling: For outbound campaigns; calls dial automatically based on agent availability.
* Progressive Dialling: Calls made one after another rather than predictive.
* Preview Dialler: Agent sees the contact and clicks â€œcallâ€� , cost INR300/user/month if using SIM-based approach (not full centralized server).
* Call Recording: Available at INR250/user/month (cloud). On-premise can store locally; if you request recordings manually: INR5,000 per request.
* Live Call Transcription: Only available on on-premise due to heavy server requirements.
* Sticky Calls: Ensures the same agent gets the call back; cost INR3,000/user/month (min 10 users). Setup time 5-10 days.
* Multi-server load: Platform can handle hundreds/thousands of concurrent calls by linking multiple servers; one central CRM faÃ§ade controls them.
  **Important Legal Notes:**
* PRI numbers are landline and come with area code for state (e.g., 011 for Delhi).
* GSM gateway with SIM cards typically limited to ~5 concurrent channels per gateway.
* Cold-calling restrictions: In India, using random cold lists via PRI/GSM is illegal; the system supports inbound messages (WhatsApp) then calls, which is permissible.
* The client is responsible for legal compliance in their country , MYLINEHUB provides the tech under contract.

### 3.3 AI RAG Chatbot & Knowledge Engine

**Core Idea:** Using Retrieval-Augmented Generation to power chatbots that can reference internal documents, CRM databases, telephony/WhatsApp records, and generate responses that are context-aware.
**Capabilities:**

* Ingestion: PDF, Word, Excel, website links, OCR from images, audio-to-text transcripts.
* Chunking and embedding: Data broken into manageable token windows, stored in vector DB with metadata (document name, source, date, organisation).
* Retrieval: Semantic search finds relevant chunks for user query.
* Generation: LLM uses retrieved context to craft coherent, accurate responses to end-user.
* Workflow automation: The system can ask follow-up questions when needed, e.g., â€œPlease provide your order IDâ€� to fulfil a sales scenario.
* Order integration: For customers selling products, the chatbot can gather data and call downstream APIs to create orders after payment success (custom dev).
* Token-billing: RAG processing cost one-time INR10,000 for up to 10 million tokens. Re-uploads allowed up to 5 times within 2-month window before new charge.
  **Use-Cases:**
* Customer support bot on WhatsApp or web chat.
* Sales assistant that can pull product info, pricing, discounts, and initiate checkout.
* Internal agent assist bot that helps staff find customer records or call transcriptions quickly.
* Knowledge base bot for call-centre staff training and information retrieval.

### 3.4 Custom Software Development

**Stack:**

* Backend: Java, Python, Node.js
* Frontend: Angular, React
* Databases: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB
* APIs: REST, GraphQL, Webhooks
  **Services:**
* Rapid development of modules such as connectors to external CRMs, payment gateways, e-commerce, voice analytics, dashboards.
* Clients pay for custom API integrations: INR50,000 per integration (approx 3-5 working days).
* On-premise clients purchase licence per user (INR25,000/user lifetime for back-end embedding) and initial support/training once.
* Cloud clients can request custom modules , cost depends on current spend; possible discount if high traffic client.

## Section 6: Legalities & Compliance

### WhatsApp / Meta Cloud API Rules

* Outbound initiation can only be done via **approved templates**, not free-form messages.
* After a customer sends a message, the business has a 24 hour window to respond. After that, messaging must revert to template mode.
* Message editing via the API is **not supported** , once a message is sent, it cannot be edited.
* Usage of automation must adhere to Meta's policies to prevent number blocking (spam detection). MYLINEHUB ensures architecture that minimises risk of number blocking by using compliant workflows.

### Telecommunication Legalities (India)

* PRI lines: Landline numbers assigned by telecom regulator with geography-based codes (e.g., 011 for Delhi).
* GSM Gateway: Uses SIM cards; limited to a handful of channels per gateway (~5) due to hardware/telecom limitations.
* Cold-calling restrictions: Using random lists to dial outbound calls via PRI or GSM is regulated; MYLINEHUB supports legitimate inboundcall workflows to remain compliant.
* International usage: While the system can technically connect global numbers, clients must ensure local legal compliance; MYLINEHUB does not assume legal liability for local number usage or cold-call lists.

### Data Security & Ownership

* Data belongs to the client organisation. MYLINEHUB stores data but does not claim ownership; employees have limited access and each organisation's data is isolated.
* No source code is provided to clients in cloud model , only binaries. On-premise clients must manage their own maintenance (unless contracted).
* Audit logs, role-based access control (RBAC), encryption (AES-256) and segregated environments ensure data safety.
* On-premise option gives full control of data but requires client to handle infrastructure, maintenance and backups.

---

## Section 7: Data Security & Privacy

* Encryption: All data at rest and in transit is encrypted (AES-256 or equivalent).
* Segregation: Each organisation's data is partitioned logically/physically to prevent cross-client leakage.
* Access Control: Roles include Admin, Manager, Employee; only Admin/Manager can access dashboards and user-management, employees have limited rights.
* Audit Trail: Full logs of actions (who accessed what, when) are maintained.
* Export & Integration: Clients can export data (Excel format) or access via secure API. MYLINEHUB also supports data import from external systems (Excel, PDF, DB dump).
* Compliance: Aligns with Indian IT Act and is compatible with GDPR-style obligations for international usage.
* On-premise: For clients requiring full control of data (especially in regulated industries), the on-premise model ensures data stays entirely on client servers.

---

## Section 9: RAG Integration Framework

### Pipeline Overview

1. **Data Ingestion**

   * Documents: Word, Excel, PDF, PowerPoint
   * Web content: Website links, YouTube transcription, blog posts
   * Multimedia: Audio, video  converted via speech-to-text, OCR for images
   * CRM/Telephony Logs: WhatsApp message logs, call recordings metadata
2. **Chunking & Embedding**

   * Break each document into chunks of ~1,000â€“1,500 tokens with ~15% overlap to preserve context
   * Create embeddings (vector representation) and store in vector database with metadata (source, date, organisation, doc-type)
3. **Storage & Indexing**

   * Vector DB stores embedding + text chunk + metadata
   * Persistent storage of original document for audit/reference
4. **Retrieval**

   * Query processed via semantic similarity search
   * Top-k relevant chunks retrieved (e.g., k=10)
   * Relevance scoring and filtering applied
5. **Generation**

   * LLM uses the retrieved chunks + prompt to generate response to user
   * System can flag if follow-up questions needed (question-back feature)
6. **Integration into WhatsApp / CRM / Telephony**

   * Chatbot embedded into WhatsApp channel; grabs user context, issues reply, logs conversation
   * For calls: transcripts or meta logs can be ingested to add context into RAG store
7. **Governance & Update Policy**

   * Version control: Each RAG ingestion event produces a version number
   * Allowed 5 updates / re-uploads within 2 months after initial RAG creation (cost covered)
   * After 2 months, new token-quota cost applies
   * Audit logs kept for data changes, ingestion events, user queries

### Example Schema: Vector Store Metadata

| Field            | Description                           |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| doc_id           | Unique document identifier            |
| chunk_id         | Identifier for each chunk             |
| organisation_id  | Client organisation identifier        |
| source_type      | e.g., â€œPDFâ€�, â€œWebsiteâ€�, â€œWhatsAppLogâ€� |
| source_date      | Date of ingestion                     |
| embedding_vector | Numeric vector representing chunk     |
| text_chunk       | Text content of the chunk             |
| tokens_count     | Number of tokens in chunk             |

### Example Query-Response Flow

**User Query:** â€œWhat happens if my WhatsApp number is blocked after too many messages?â€�
**System Retrieval:** fetches chunks from â€œLegalities & Complianceâ€� doc, â€œWhatsApp policyâ€�, and â€œMYLINEHUB FAQâ€�
**LLM Response:** â€œIf your WhatsApp number sends a large number of outbound messages without user-initiated conversation or violates Meta's template rules, it may be flagged for spam and blocked. At MYLINEHUB we ensure your messaging workflow begins with incoming message, records the 24-hour session window, uses approved templates for outbound, and monitors failed/undelivered rates via dashboard. This lowers risk of blocking.â€�
**Follow-up Question (if needed):** â€œWould you like me to check how many template messages you have used in the last 24â€‰hours?â€�

### Chunking & Token Strategy

* Recommended chunk size: 1,000â€“1,500 tokens
* Overlap: ~15% to maintain context across chunks
* Embedding model: (select based on client preference; can be open-source or licensed)
* Retrieval top-k: typically 10â€“15 chunks
* Max tokens for generation input: ~4,000 tokens (adjust based on model capacity)

### Update & Maintenance Policy

* Re-upload of documents allowed up to 5 times within first 2 months post-RAG creation at no extra cost
* After 2 months or 5 updates, new RAG creation requires re-billing (INR10,000 per 10 M tokens)
* Clients should regularly purge outdated documents and schedule quarterly review of knowledge base
* Backup policy: On-premise clients maintain backups; cloud clients handled by MYLINEHUB infrastructure
